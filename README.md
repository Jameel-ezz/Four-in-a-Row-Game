Four-in-a-Row-Game

This Java code defines a simple implementation of the "Four in a Row" game using a graphical user interface (GUI) with Java Swing. The game is played on a 6x7 grid, and two players take turns dropping tokens of different colors into columns. The first player to connect four of their tokens either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

Here's a summary of the key functionalities:

The game GUI includes buttons representing each column where players can drop their tokens.
The game board is represented by a 2D array (board) where player tokens are placed.
The dropInColumn method is responsible for placing a token in the selected column.
The checkForWin method checks if the last move resulted in a win, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The game handles player turns, updates the GUI, and displays the winner or a draw.
The GUI includes a panel (GamePanel) that visually represents the game board with colored circles for each player's token.
The main method creates an instance of the FourInARow class, making the game visible.
In summary, this code implements a basic interactive version of the Four in a Row game with a graphical interface using Java Swing.
